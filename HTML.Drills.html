        <h1>This Movie is hilarious!</h1>
        <p>
        Fandango is a very funny movie about a group of guys that just graduated high school that set out on an adventure. It can be described as the "Hangover" movie of the early 80's that not many people know about.

    <p>I have always been tech savy, and have a natural talent to "learn by doing." The learning curve for me to learn a new program is short. I first operated a Radio Shack, TRS-80 computer in 3rd grade during a summer computer camp. That was 1983, and my parents knew that
    what the future meant when computer came out. That Christmas my brother and I got a TRS-80, and I can remember typing code from a big book for the computer
    that would allow you to run programs that would make circles, squares, cars going down the road, and visual graphics.

    I hope to be able to afford my first set of golf clubs soon.  I go to the gym about 4 days/week, as I use this as my zen and meditation lifting weights and using the spa.

        </ul>
    <p>I am the oldest sibling in the family, and grew up in Saraland, Al. which is a small town just north of Mobile. We had a great, loving family grwowing up.  My brother's name is Randall, and he is a very successful chef.  He works at Dyron's Low Country in Mountain Brook and has a natural talent for creating the most amazing dishes. My sister tragically passed away in September 2016. She was the most beautiful person inside and out, and we had a very special connection. I can still hear her laugh and see her smile, and its very sad to think about her from time to time.
    She left behind a young son who know lives in Grand Junction, Co. He is very lucky to have a wonderful father and is very healthy. My mother passed away from cancer in 2004, and I still miss her to this day. I was not in a very good place when she passed, and did ot handle her loss very well.  She knew I would be a late bloomer, as I didn't really have any motivation to find my passion in life, build a career, and be successful.
    In 2008 I had enough of living in Mobile and decided to move to Birmingham where my brother and sister lived. It was very hard getting adjusted, and took about a year to settle in.
    I worked small jobs here and there, mostly hotel front desk positions. Eventually I had an awakening which trnsisitoned into a new ambition to become successful. 
    I got a Assistant General Manager poition with A.U.M. Enterprise Hotel Franchise management company, and later became a General Manager of a Fairfield Inn & Suites in Fultondale, Al.

        </ul>
    <p>I have had this G.M. position since 2010, and in 2015 I started my online classes at U.A.B. At first I just wanted a Business Management Degree to further my career and have "a degree."
    Then I had somewhat of a divine intervention when talking to my advisor. I noticed the M.I.S. core curriculum, and noticed that if I changed to that major, I would only
    have to take an additonal three semesters to get a degree in that field. I knew that this was my calling, a long awaited calling since the days of 1983 and the Radio Shack TRS-80 computer.
    My story is long, it's filled with many adventures, life experiences, lessons, failures, success, hard work, and determination.
